## GOALS

Edit and view an activity page

* Activity has 
	o list of elements 
		o (html-text element?)
		o question (q1)
			o prompt "what do you think blah blah"
			o response (empty input)
		o question
		o something else  "when you were you were thinking about how this worked, you said 'blah blah (answer from q1)'
		

Example:
	colors are great.  blah blah blah.
	<div class="question" id="234234">
		<div class="prompt">whats your favorite color?</div>
		<div class="default response"></div>
		<div id="response"></div>
	</div>
	

## Models

./script/generate model activity owner_id:integer name:string xhtml:text uuid:string
./script/generate model question activity_id:integer prompt:string default_response:string uuid:string
./script/generate model response owner_id:integer question_id:integer uuid:string
./script/generate model Owner first_name:string last_name:string uuid:string

Question 1:
	if you are using a WYSIWG (FCK, YUI Editor, TinyMCE) Editor, how can you insert something which is a custom object?
	
	Large area for formatted text, but drag things into the editor.  
		You want to be able to edit the properties of these elements in the GUI.
		Editor can render both HTML and Plain text, but is not likely to render a graph, yet.
		
	Back into the OTML <object refid="sdfsdfdsf" />




Also we would like to be able to reference the answers to questions
	<div class="question" id="1234">
		<div class="answer" id="23433">
			<div class="stad"></div>
		</div>
	</div>
	
misc concepts:
	- editing mode / vs running mode
